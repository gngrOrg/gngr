This is the source code of [gngr](https://gngr.info), a new cross-platform browser that champions privacy. `gngr`
is an independent implementation of web standards in pure Java. It is *not* a wrapper around other browser engines.

`gngr` plans to protect privacy by
* disabling the following by default: Cookies, Javascript, and XHR requests. As well as providing [fine granuality of control](https://github.com/UprootLabs/gngr/wiki/RequestManager) over them.
* by implementing in a high-level language that is easier to audit
* by using run-time sandboxing

Read [the introduction](https://gngr.info/doc/introduction.html) to know more.

### Status
This is an early prototype that is usable with simple websites.

Security-wise, the code isn't hardened *at all!* Use the current version:
 * with [app level sandboxing](https://github.com/UprootLabs/gngr/wiki/App-Sandboxing) 
 * with simple, trusted web-sites only
 * periodically [clear the browser cache and data](https://github.com/UprootLabs/gngr/wiki/Clearing-cache-and-data).

**Do Not use the current version with critical websites such as banking websites or web-mail.**

### Development Status [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/UprootLabs/gngr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/UprootLabs/gngr)

As of July 2016, our focus is to improve layout and rendering. We have developed
[grinder](https://github.com/UprootLabs/grinder) to automate layout and rendering tests. Here's a chart showing our progress *(click for more details)*:

We are also using [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/) for
stabilising the DOM support.

### Building

For building and running from the command line:

  1. `git clone` this repo
  2. `ant -f src/build.xml run` to build and run `gngr`

For developing, we recommend [setting up Eclipse](https://github.com/UprootLabs/gngr/wiki/Developer:Setup), although it
is possible to use other IDEs or command line tools as well, with the help of the `ant` build script.

### Pre-History
`gngr` began as a fork of the now-defunct project called the `lobo` browser (see [credits](https://gngr.info/doc/credits.html)).
For archival purposes, the history of all commits that transform `lobo` code from its CVS repository to the very first version of gngr is available in [a separate repository](https://github.com/UprootLabs/gngrPreHistoric).
